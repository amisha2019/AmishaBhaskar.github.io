I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), advised by Dr. Pratap Tokekar. My research interests lie in the learning algorithms, reinforcement learning and imitation learning in particular, and their applications in assistive-robotcs. 

I completed BTech in 2018 from [University of Delhi (DU)](http://nsut.ac.in/en/home) in Mechanical Engineering. I also earned a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I co-founded PerceptionAI, where we developed AI-driven tools to revolutionize how product managers interact with data, boosting efficiency by tenfold.
